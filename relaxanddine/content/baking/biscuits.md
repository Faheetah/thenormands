Ingredients
---

1 cup gf flour with xantham gum (1to1 or Cup4Cup)
1 cup super fine white rice flour
1/2 tsp salt
4 tsp tbsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
8 tbsp (1 stick) frozen butter
About 1 cup buttermilk (enough to make it thoroughly moist but not tacky)

Directions
---

Preheat 450F. Thoroughly mix dry ingredients. Shred frozen butter into dry and mix lightly. Incorporate in the buttermilk carefully, enough for the dry to soak up the buttermilk.

Gently press out to 1" to 1.5‚Äù thick disk, fold and press out, total of 3 times. Cut with a biscuit cutter dusted with flour. Press straight down and give a slight twist to break the biscuit free, taking care to not disturb the cut side. Place just touching on a baking sheet. For a flat top, make a shallow indent on the top of each biscuit. Bake for about 10-15 minutes until starting to turn golden.
