Ingredients
---

1 chuck roast, about 3-4lb
1 whole onion
4 large carrots
2 parsnips
4 cloves garlic
A whole savoy cabbage

1 tbsp thyme
1 tbsp rosemary
1 tbsp sweet paprika
1 tbsp powdered garlic
1/2 tsp ground mustard
1 tbsp salt
Several grinds of black pepper
A couple dashes of red wine vinegar
A splash of a good red wine, if available


Directions
---

Sear the roast well in a cast iron skillet to develop a good brown crust. Meanwhile, coarsly chop onion and slices of carrot to a crock pot, cover with water and set for 10 hours. Add pot roast and cover with water. Add thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Go to work, or sleep, or otherwise pass 10 hours of time.

Once the roast is falling apart and carrots are tender, pour a few cups of broth out into a wide pan or saucier. Bring to a boil and add the paprika, garlic powder, and mustard powder. Reduce down until the sauce thickens and looks like syrup. Add the vinegar, and if opening a bottle of wine, add a small splash. Serve over savoy leaves and drizzle with the sauce and a fruity merlot.

Savoy Cabbage

While the sauce reduces, turn a cast iron pan to medium-high and add lard or bacon grease, olive oil will suffice. Peel the outer layers of the cabbage off and keep them moderately in tact, about 4-6 pieces. Slice the thick part of the stem off so they will lay flat in the pan, start with the concave side and press with a spatula until the brown from the other side shows through. Flip and cook the same amount of time to get a good brown color. Shred some more of the cabbage and sautee on high heat, getting a nice brown color, to act as a bed under the pot roast.

Leftovers make a great base for shepherds pie or tacos.
