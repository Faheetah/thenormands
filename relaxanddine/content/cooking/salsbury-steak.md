Ingredients
---

1lb ground beef, good quality
3 tbsp butter
1/2 sweet onion (or a whole one, why not? Why... not)
2 cups beef or lamb broth
A few dashes of worchester
1 tsp thyme
1/2 tsp marjoram
1 tbsp paprika
1 tsp powdered garlic
A couple dashes of apple cider vinegar
3 mini bella mushrooms


Directions
---

Carmelize most of the onion, saving a couple tablespoons finely diced for the meat.

To save time, you can start reducing the broth down in a separate pan for the jus. Add worchester, thyme, marjoram, paprika, powdered garlic, and vinegar.

Once the onions are carmelized, dump into the jus and continue reducing. Use the left over butter in the pan to cook the mushrooms. Fip the mushrooms once they begin to brown, and once both sides are done add to jus.

Brown two 1/2 patties, thick, in the buttery pan. Brown on both sides then add to the jus.

Once the meat reaches 160F in the center, remove and spoon the jus over the patties. Serve with peas and carrots with a good mash. Pairs well with a good tempranillo or carmenere, or a wine with good stone fruit.
