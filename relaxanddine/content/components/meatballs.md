Ingredients
===

2 lb ground beef or lamb, or 50/50 of both
1 lb ground pork
1 slice of bread, very stale, shredded
1 large egg
2 tbsp each of: 
oregano
sage
garlic powder
onion powder
salt
pepper

Directions
===

Preheat oven to 425F. Shred the stale bred with a fine grater, to crumbs. Mix with seasoning and egg. Mix very well with the ground meat. Use a disher appropriate to the size of desired meatball to portion out each meatball. Roll in hand until round and slightly compacted. Place meatballs spaced evenly on a half baking sheet with its fitted grill (see image). Bake in oven until tops begin to brown and meatballs reach an internal temperature of 160F.

For spaghetti and meatballs, boil the meatballs in the sauce as it cooks.
