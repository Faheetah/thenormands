Ingredients
===

1 cup cornmeal
1 cup 1to1 flour
1 cup rice flour
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon salt
something to fry
oil to fry it in (high temperature oil like canola, peanut, corn, no olive oil)

Directions
===

Beat the egg. Mix the flours and salt together. Dip what you want to fry into the egg mixture and press into the cornmeal. The idea is to get a goopy mess of eggs and press a lot of cornmeal mixture into it so it gets soaked. Refrigerate or freeze until the dough mixture becomes cohesive. The food should not need to fully freeze, but freezing is okay as long as internal temperature for meats is taken into consideration. Before frying, check that the oil you are using has a smoke point of at least 400F. Heat the oil to exactly 375F. A high sided small pot works well. The oil should not be smoking but should shimmer. Drop the items to fry cafefully into the oil but do not crowd the pan. Flip when one side starts to look crispy. If the oil starts to smoke from breading debris, replace the oil or skim large chunks out. Remove fried food once the breading is light golden to a wire rack. Serve with your favorite sauce.

Note: For meats such as chicken and fish, use a thermometer to ensure the internal temperature is at least 150F. This is especially important when frying frozen food.

Explanation
===

The starches in the breading create a barrier around the item being fried, causing it to stay juicy, while the water in the breading boils and pushes the oil away. Because of this, deep frying is a dry cooking technique. By using egg, we can help the starch by making the breading cohesive without making it gummy like starch is known for. We press the breading against a liberal amount of egg wash and let it sit so the egg has time to soak, otherwise the breading falls right off and causes the oil to smoke and food to taste burnt. Refrigerating or freezing helps the egg to set with the breading and freezing lets us prep fried foods in advance.
