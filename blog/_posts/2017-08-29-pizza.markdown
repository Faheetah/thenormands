Preheat oven at 350Â°

1.5 cups almond flour
1 tsp salt

1/2 cup shredded cheese (harder is better)

Take a bite yourself because cheese. Shred. Mix well with dry mixture.

2 small eggs

Mix well then mix with dry ingredients until cohesive. Add a bit more almond flour if it is too wet, about 1/8 of a cup.

Press under two pieces of parchment paper and roll out as thin as possible while keeping it even and not lumpy.

Peel top parchment paper off. Slide onto cookie sheet and bake to 10-12 until begins to turn golden around the edges. 

Pull out of oven and add ingredients and put it back in another 10-12 minutes or until it looks like pizza.
