1. Grill onions on stove in cast iron pan so they dehydrate slightly.

3. When onions are done, move to chili mixture. Blend chili mixture. 
4. Lightly salt and brown meat in cast iron. Drain meat and add with masa to pot and mix well. 
- I put the masa in the pot and brown the meat in 1lb batches and move to pot as it's ready. 
5. Add chili seasoning. Add enough water to make it sloshy. Slow cook (while adding water as needed) until it looks like chili, usually four to âˆž hours.
