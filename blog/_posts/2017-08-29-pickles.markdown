Ingredients
===

1 1/4 cup vinegar (can just be a heaping cup)
1 cup water
1 tsp pickling salt
1 garlic clove
1 bay leaf
Whatever you want to pickle

Directions
===

Boil the vinegar, water, and salt. Put the bay leaf, garlic, and pickle in a thick glass jar. Once the vinegar mixture is a roaring boil, pour into jar. Do not pack pickles too tightly. Thicker items such as carrots or green beans may need to be parboiled in the vinegar mixture briefly to get desired texture.

Pickles should stay crisp. Pickles that start wilting or have a slimy appearance should be discarded. Keeps about a week.
